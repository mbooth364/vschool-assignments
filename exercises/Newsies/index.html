        <h1>How to Start a Food truck in Las Vegas</h1>
        </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Easily one of the biggest tourist and business destinations in the country, Las Vegas has become quite legendary in all things fun, exciting, ‘bad,’ and otherwise appealing to people of all interests. The City that Never Sleeps is always filled with lights and people looking for something to do, including eating and embibement. Thus is Vegas known for its countless high class restaurants and bars; even if you’re not into gambling, one can always revel in the food aspect of the city between shows. 
        One can certainly find success with opening up a food business here, so it’s no surprise that food trucks have been flourishing for years now as they take advantage of the sun-filled, tree and light-lined streets.</p>
        <p>As with any city, starting up a food truck here isn’t particularly easy, but getting past those initial difficulties and learning how to take advantage of local and flowing tourist populations, usually with something unique/trendy but with strong return-visit appeal, can lead to success. Many a truck has been going on for the 4-6 year period of popularity so far, getting together to take advantage of popular streets an events going on year-round in this winter-absent area.Sadly it seems the Las Vegas Food Truck Coalition only survived until 2013, a surprise considering how many trucks are out there and how busy of a city it is.</p>
        <p>Luckily there’s still plenty of trucks one can contact to look for advice and organization plans… that is, if they’ll actually respond (local owner attitudes are rather up in the air about this). Okay, before we actually get into it, I should warn readers that the first answer is QUITE a long one. I was planning on cutting it down, but after reading through it thoroughly I just could not take the step to get rid of any word Kelly wrote down here; it’s all things that I think deserves to be out there. So enjoy, expect an interesting story followed by some REALLY informative and reliable information on the Vegas truck scene.
