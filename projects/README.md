Projects are assignments specifically geared towards testing my ability to demonstrate an understand in a collection of topics.
Projects represent a culmination both of topics that have been recently learned 
as well as those that have already been tested in the past.  Passing a project is akin to "earning a merit badge" 
or "leveling up."  As time progresses, the projects become more intense, as they naturally build off of everything I've learned
up to the point of the project.  In the becinning, they're due in 1 or 2 days.  Towards the end of the course , I'm
usually given 1 to 2 weeks to complete a project.
